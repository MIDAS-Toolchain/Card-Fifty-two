# Card Fifty-Two: Character Classes

## Overview

Card Fifty-Two features **three starting character classes** plus one **unlockable fourth class**. Each character experiences the same casino nightmare differently, with unique mechanics and narrative perspectives.

All characters share the **sanity meter** mechanic, but how they respond to losing sanity reflects their archetype.

---

## The Desperate

**Archetype**: Gambling addict seeking the big win

### Starting Condition
- High initial chip count (false confidence)
- Standard blackjack rules
- Believes they can win their way out

### Narrative Arc
The Desperate thinks this is about winning. They're wrong. As sanity drops, they lose control—compulsive betting, chasing losses, unable to stop even when they know better.

### Low Sanity Mechanics
- **Loses Agency**: Forced into "ALL IN" bets at critical moments
- **Compulsive Draws**: Must hit on certain hands (even when bust is guaranteed)
- **High-Risk Synergies**: Gains powerful bonuses for reckless plays
- **Narrative Reveals**: Discovers they've been here before. Many times.

### Playstyle
- High-risk, high-reward
- Rewards aggressive betting strategies
- Punishes conservative play at low sanity

---

## The Dealer

**Archetype**: Former casino employee who knows the system

### Starting Condition
- Low initial chip count (realistic expectations)
- Understands dealer behavior patterns
- Knows the house always wins—unless you break the house

### Narrative Arc
The Dealer recognizes the AI dealers as corrupted versions of themselves. As sanity drops, they stop playing *by* the rules and start playing *with* the rules—bending, breaking, exploiting.

### Low Sanity Mechanics
- **Gains Agency**: Can manipulate house rules mid-hand
- **Dealer Arguments**: Argues with AI dealers, forcing re-deals or rule changes
- **System Exploitation**: Sees hidden probabilities, card counting buffs
- **Narrative Reveals**: Discovers they didn't escape—they became part of the system

### Playstyle
- Strategic, calculated
- Rewards system knowledge and pattern recognition
- Becomes more powerful at low sanity (dangerous trade-off)

---

## The Detective

**Archetype**: Investigator searching for missing persons

### Starting Condition
- Moderate chip count
- Special ability: "Case Notes" (tracks AI dealer patterns)
- Believes this is a crime scene, not a game

### Narrative Arc
The Detective treats every hand as evidence. As sanity drops, they realize evidence is meaningless—truth is negotiable, reality is subjective, and the cards lie.

### Low Sanity Mechanics
- **Reality Warping**: Can declare cards as different values ("This 7 is actually a King")
- **Evidence Fabrication**: Rewrite hand outcomes after the fact
- **Witness Testimony**: Force AI dealers to "confess" information
- **Narrative Reveals**: The missing persons are still here. They're the dealers. And the Detective is next.

### Playstyle
- Investigative, methodical
- Rewards observation and deduction
- Low sanity grants godlike powers (at the cost of comprehending reality)

---

## The Dreamer (Unlockable)

**Unlock Requirement**: Beat the game at **fully insane** (0 sanity) with all three prior characters.

### Starting Condition
- Knows it's not real
- Starts at 50% sanity (already compromised)
- Can see the "code" behind the casino

### Narrative Arc
The Dreamer has meta-awareness. They know they're in a game. They know the player is controlling them. They know none of this matters—and that's precisely why it's horrifying.

### Low Sanity Mechanics
- **Fourth Wall Breaks**: Talks to the player directly
- **Save/Load Awareness**: References previous runs, comments on player decisions
- **Narrative Collapse**: Story becomes unstable—contradictory, recursive, self-aware
- **True Ending Access**: Only the Dreamer can confront The Dogma

### Playstyle
- Meta-gaming taken literal
- Rewards experimentation and subversion
- Breaks traditional game logic intentionally

## Character Unlock Progression

1. **Start**: Play as **The Desperate**
2. **After First Clear**: Unlock **The Dealer**
3. **After Second Clear**: Unlock **The Detective**
4. **After Three 0-Sanity Clears**: Unlock **The Dreamer**

Each playthrough reveals more of the true story. Each character sees a different angle of the same nightmare.

---

## Design Philosophy

**The Desperate** asks: *Can I win?*
**The Dealer** asks: *Can I cheat?*
**The Detective** asks: *What is real?*
**The Dreamer** answers: *Nothing. Everything. Does it matter?*

Each character is a different stage of accepting the absurd:
1. Denial (Desperate)
2. Bargaining (Dealer)
3. Investigation (Detective)
4. Acceptance (Dreamer)

Not the five stages of grief—the four stages of **recursive absurdism**.

*"You are not playing against the dealers. You are playing against the idea that you can win."*
