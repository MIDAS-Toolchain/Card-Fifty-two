so you have an animation frame struct that holds al the pictures and an actual animation struct that holds the array of animation frrames, counta capicity, time between frames. Animation handler to orchestrate and safely easily play/stop/switch animations for the entity/object , now every time you create that object/entity , you can easily have the pre-registered animations you defined and then call them quite simply in code later! An object or entity would have a struct, you can plop in animation handler t into that scruct for anything you want animated (as long as it has a a_texture_T because thats what gets animated or surfaces that turn into textures whatever, look at how my cards do it because thats an example!) so then on the spawn/create function you can implement your own function (we can create user-friendly helpers/utils for this) to programatically load in your animations, name them, time them , and then later orchestrate them through the existing struct's a_AnimationHandler_t
